# AStarAlgorithm

A star algorithm would be the best algorithm for our Smart Parking Management System. We came to the conclusion because it provides the shortest available path and most cost efficient path The A star algorithm takes advantage of a heuristic function, which is used to estimate the cost of movement from the starting point to the final destination During the development, it came to our attention that we needed to write the algorithm in a way that would not be computationally expensive and provide very little latency for the application We decided to write the program in C++, because it provides helpful functionalities that would make the algorithm development much simpler C++ offers helpful traits such as being object oriented, its memory management, scalability and its vast functional libraries The steps in which the A star algorithm follows can be depicted in the flowchart in AstarAlgorithmFlow.jpg. Some alterations that we had to make to the A star algorithm in order for it to be compatible with our parking system, was to include a map of the layout of the parking facility Normally, this algorithm recommends using pointers to indicate the multiple paths that are available, in our case it made more sense to introduce a 2 dimensional integer grid We used 1 to indicate an existing parking spot and 0 as free space for the vehicles to roam Also, during development we needed to decide on how we would want to calculate the distance between the starting point and final point of the userâ€™s path We came to the conclusion to use the Euclidean distance formula, because it would give accurate results regardless of the different parking facility layouts.
